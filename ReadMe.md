### Hi everyone! Iâ€™ve developed my second Node.js API with Express.jsðŸ˜Š

### Before you start, make sure to add your .env file.I am going to provide sample .env file template below. After that, youâ€™ll need to install the necessary Node modules.

Here are some key points about my project:

#### User Registration and Tokens:

- Users must register with credentials below.

```javascript
{
  "name": "Arda Åžen",//required
  "email": "ardasen.96@gmail.com",//required
  "password": "123456",//required
  "street": "123 Main Street",
  "apartment": "Apt 4",
  "city": "Cityville",
  "zip": "12345",
  "country": "Countryland",
  "phone": "123-456-7890",//required
  "isAdmin": true
}
```

- After register , they receive an access token for business logic.Here is the sample login request below

```js
{
  "email":"ardasen.96@gmail.com",
  "password":"123456"
}
```

#### Category Operations:

- Admin can add new categories, update existing ones, and list categories.

#### Product Operations:

- Admin can add new products, update existing ones, and list products.
- Everyone can acces all products.
- "GET /featured/:count" Used to retrieve the count of featured products, up to the specified amount. This endpoint checks the "isFeatured" property among the products. If the "isFeatured" property of a product is true, it is considered a featured product.

#### User Operations:

- User can change password
- Admin can receive user count , all user and get a user

#### Order Operations:

- Admin can do basic CRUD operations , receive Total sales and user orders

### What I Learned from This Project:

- User Authentication with express-jwt in Node.js. Iâ€™ve implemented secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
- I learned how to use service layer.

#### Sample .env file content

- DATABASE_URI= "your connection"
- ACCES_TOKEN_SECRET="your secret"
- REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET="your secret"
- API_URL=/api/v1
